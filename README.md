## 🔧 How it Works

- Runs a modern HTTP server with WebSocket support
- Provides a beautiful, animated file browser interface
- Automatically watches for file changes
- Injects a tiny WebSocket client for hot reload
- Handles all static files with proper MIME types
- Supports both light and dark themes

## Why use this? 🤔

* No bulky frameworks or dev servers needed
* Great for quick prototyping or static sites
* Hot reload keeps your flow unbroken
* Perfect for developers who love minimalism and speed

## 💡 Tips

- The server automatically finds a free port if the default is in use
- All HTML files get hot-reload capability automatically
- Use dark mode for better visibility in low light
- Click column headers to sort files
- Works great with any static web project

## 🛟 Troubleshooting

If you see "Address already in use":
- The server will automatically try the next available port
- You can also specify a different port: `python dev_server.py 8080`

If hot reload isn't working:
- Make sure your browser supports WebSocket
- Check if the WebSocket port is not blocked by firewall
